Pineal Loop Project
===================

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edne/PinealLoopProject/master/icon.png)

* Play your music
* Run PinealLoopProject.py
* Run analysis.scd with SuperCollider
(I use the SuperCollider IDE, sometimes needs to be run with ctrl-enter twice)
* edit a .py file in the `visuals` folder or create a new one
(the drawing functions are defined in `scr/header.py`)
* Have fun!


Dependencies:
* a working Jack Audio Connection Kit (i'm sorry)
* python-pyo
* python-numpy
* python-opengl
* python-pil (python-imaging on ubuntu)
