Pineal
======
An engine for graphic live-coding on an audio stream, something between 
[Fluxus](http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/), 
__but in Python!__  
(ok that's not true, it was in Python, now the back-end is in a 
[pythonic Lisp dialect](http://hylang.org), but the part you can live-code 
is still in Python and I'm not planning to change that)
